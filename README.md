# Kotlin in a nutshell :books:

This repository represents a guide for getting started with Kotlin.

There are two different ways on how to learn Kotlin in this repo:

1. [Project One: Spring boot microservice](project-one/README.md)
2. [Project Two: Coding challenge](project-two/README.md)

Be aware that the coding challenge doesn't include a guide on how to achieve the correct solution. Both projects expect you to have basic
knowledge of Java.
